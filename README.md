## Summary
I am a dedicated student pursuing a degree in Electronics & Computer Science Engineering with a strong interest in robotics. Alongside my studies, I have a notable knack for graphic design, which I have been exploring through freelancing. While my primary passion lies in robotics, I aim to harness my graphic design skills and transform it into a side venture to complement my robotics journey.

## Projects
- **Sign Language Recognition For Mute And Deaf**
  - Nov 2023 - Apr 2024
  - Associated with Shree L. R. Tiwari College of Engineering
  - A computer vision-based sign language recognition system using Machine Learning models, Python, and OpenCV. The system accurately recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real time, enabling efficient communication for newly deaf/mute individuals. By training the model on a comprehensive dataset, we ensure rapid and precise conversion of ASL gestures into text, promoting inclusivity. Thorough testing proves the system works well in different situations, connecting people with and without disabilities and promoting an inclusive society.

- **Autonomous Maze Solving Robot**
  - Aug 2022 - Apr 2023
  - Associated with Shree L. R. Tiwari College of Engineering
  - Our objective was to design and develop a 2-Wheel Simple Maze Solving Robot that could navigate through a simple maze without colliding with any of the walls. Components used included L298N Motor Driver, Arduino UNO board, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, TowerPro SG 90 Micro Servo Motor, BO Series 1 100RPM Plastic Gear DC Motors, 65mm Robot Wheels (Yellow) for the BO Motors, Acrylic Chassis for 2-wheel Robot, and various screws and nut bolts for assembly. The project showcased problem-solving skills and practical application of robotics concepts.
